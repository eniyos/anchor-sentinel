//! `cpi_signer_seed_validation` — flags `invoke_signed` calls whose signer
//! seeds cannot be verified at analysis time.
//!
//! In Solana, `invoke_signed` lets a program sign on behalf of a PDA it
//! owns. The runtime derives the PDA from the seeds the program passes
//! in, so the seeds themselves are the only thing standing between
//! legitimate and forged signing. If the seeds come from user input
//! (function args, account fields without `.key().as_ref()`, or any
//! unresolvable expression) the attacker can compute their own valid
//! PDA and have the program sign for it. The Sealevel-Attacks "fake
//! PDA" and "withdraw without signing" patterns both rely on this.
//!
//! Severity: Critical — direct fund drain, often paired with a downstream
//! `lamports -= amount` that the user-facing report doesn't see.
//!
//! Safe seed forms:
//!   - `b"..."` byte string literal
//!   - `ctx.bumps.<ident>` — Anchor-managed canonical bump
//!   - `<expr>.key().as_ref()` on a known account field
//!
//! Anything else (function args, locally-bound variables, unresolvable
//! expressions) is treated as Dynamic and produces a Critical finding.
